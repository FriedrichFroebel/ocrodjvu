</span></h3><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 464 651 2074 704">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 464 711 2076 763">and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 463 773 2075 823">sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &#8216;and what is
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 462 832 1903 881">the use of a book,&#8217; thought Alice &#8216;without pictures or conversation?
</span></p><p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 536 891 2074 943">So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 462 951 2076 1004">day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 462 1011 2072 1064">daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 461 1072 1816 1124">when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
</span></p><p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 534 1133 2074 1182">There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 461 1192 2074 1244">VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &#8216;Oh dear! Oh
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 460 1252 2073 1302">dear! I shall be late!&#8217; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 460 1311 2073 1360">her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 1369 2072 1422">quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 1431 2071 1483">ITS WAISTCOAT&#8212; POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 1493 2071 1537">started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 1552 2072 1604">seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 458 1612 2070 1663">burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 1671 1894 1722">just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 531 1730 2071 1783">In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 458 1790 1259 1838">in the world she was to get out again.
</span></p><p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 530 1850 2069 1902">The rabbit&#8212;hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 457 1910 2069 1958">dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 457 1969 2066 2022">about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
</span></p><p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 530 2030 2069 2083">Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 2089 2069 2142">of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2150 2068 2195">to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2210 2068 2259">coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2268 2067 2320">of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2329 2067 2381">shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2389 2066 2439">down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &#8216;ORAN GE
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2449 2065 2501">MARMALADE&#8217;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 2510 2066 2562">like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 2571 1286 2618">one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
</span></p><p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 528 2630 2065 2680">&#8216;Well!&#8217; thought Alice to herself, &#8216;after such a fall as this, I shall think
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 2690 2062 2740">nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&#8217;ll all think me at home!
</span><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 451 2750 2063 2800">Why, I wouldn&#8217;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!&#8217;
