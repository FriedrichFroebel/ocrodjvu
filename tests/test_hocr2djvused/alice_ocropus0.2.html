<span class="ocr_line">1 Down the Rabbit-Hole</span>
</h3>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 465 650 2075 703">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 465 710 2077 762">and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 464 772 2076 822">sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &#8216;and what is</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 463 831 1904 880">the use of a book,&#8217; thought Alice &#8216;without pictures or conversation?</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 537 890 2075 942">So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot</span>
<p class="ocr_par">
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 463 950 2077 1003">day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 463 1010 2073 1063">daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 462 1071 1817 1123">when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 535 1132 2075 1181">There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so</span>
</p>
<p class="ocr_par">
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 462 1191 2075 1243">VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &#8216;Oh dear! Oh</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 461 1251 2074 1301">dear! I shall be late!&#8217; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 461 1310 2074 1359">her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 460 1368 2073 1421">quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 460 1430 2072 1482">ITS WAISTCOAT&#8212; POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 460 1492 2072 1536">started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 460 1551 2073 1603">seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 1611 2071 1662">burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 1670 1895 1721">just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 532 1729 2072 1782">In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 1789 1260 1837">in the world she was to get out again.</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 531 1849 2070 1901">The rabbit&#8212;hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then</span>
</p>
<p class="ocr_par">
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 458 1909 2070 1957">dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 458 1968 2067 2021">about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 531 2029 2070 2082">Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty</span>
</p>
<p class="ocr_par">
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 457 2088 2070 2141">of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 2149 2069 2194">to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 2209 2069 2258">coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2267 2068 2319">of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2328 2068 2380">shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2388 2067 2438">down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &#8216;ORAN GE</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2448 2066 2500">MARMALADE&#8217;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2509 2067 2561">like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2570 1287 2617">one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 529 2629 2066 2679">&#8216;Well!&#8217; thought Alice to herself, &#8216;after such a fall as this, I shall think</span>
</p>
<p class="ocr_par">
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2689 2063 2739">nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&#8217;ll all think me at home!</span>
<span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 452 2749 2064 2799">Why, I wouldn&#8217;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!&#8217;</span>
